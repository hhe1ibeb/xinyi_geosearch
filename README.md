# GeoSearch RAG

## Project Brief
* This project explores the application of GPT-4 Vision and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to create a comprehensive street view search system
* By leveraging advanced AI capabilities, the system analyzes and retrieves specific street view data to generate detailed insights about urban landscapes. 
* The project focuses on demonstrating how these technologies can be used to identify, categorize, and extract information from street scenes, offering new ways to understand and navigate city environments. This approach has potential applications in urban planning, real estate, and location-based services.
